Trapezoid

Hermite simpson == labatto 3a
--> more stable for optimization but reduced accuracy
--> use umid as control variable, if it oscillates use midpoint, otherwise use it

Questions:
1.) For methods with midpoints, is it best to add Ymid as an extra optimization variable

2.) Hermite simpson less accurate than trapezoid method
possible that discontinuities result in instabilities
use implicit method for integrating results

3.) Ways to approximate collocation error?
Only look at error at collocation points and start/stop point, not intermediate point
