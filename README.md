# To Do

High priority:
- [x] Extend our problem definition to make use of intermediate points for integration scheme's like hermite simpson and radau.
- [x] Evaluate order of accuracy of solution.
- [ ] Implement our own adaptive, implicit ivp solver.

Low priority:
- [ ] More examples!
- [x] Add interface to ipopt
