# pydcol
This is a repository for our ME 397 Numerical methods project.

pydcol solves optimal control problems using direct collocation. pydcol was designed to find an open-loop control trajectory connecting an initial system state to a final system state over a fixed time interval with minimal control effort. Where the control effort is the integral of the sum of all the control inputs squared.

However, pydcol also allows the user to provide a custom objective function and supports free terminal states (i.e. you do not have to fix the terminal state).

pydcol solves this problem by converting the continuous ode system into a finite dimensional nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) using an integration scheme. This process is called direct collocation or simultaneous discretization.

## Getting Started
Please make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer. pydcol was developed in Python 3.8, but earlier versions of Python 3 should work.

Either `git clone` or download and unzip the repository into a folder on your computer.

It is always recommended to setup a virtual environment so that our dependencies do not mess up your system setup. To do so, run:

On Mac/Linux systems:
```
python3 -m venv pydcol-env
source pydcol-env/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```
python -m venv pydcol-env
pydcol-env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Then cd into the `pydcol` folder you downloaded.

The python modules can then be installed using: 
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

If you want to use IPOPT, extra steps are involved for installing ipyopt on non-linux systems. Please see the package for more information: https://gitlab.com/g-braeunlich/ipyopt. However, this is not mandatory to use pydcol.

If you want to be able to save the animations generated by pydcol.Animator to file, you need to install ffmpeg and set the environmental variable `FFMPEG_PATH` to the location of the ffmpeg executable (Windows users will have to restart their computer after setting the variable or Python will not recognize the variable has been set).

To confirm the setup worked properly, run the BlockMove.py example as follows:
```
cd examples
python BlockMove.py
```

## Usage
1.) Define your ode model as a list of sympy expressions. The list should only contain the right-hand-side of the ode equations. So if your system was:
```
dx/dt = v
dy/dt = u
```
your list should be: 
```
ode = [v, u]
```
2.) Distinguish control variables from state variables. This is so that the solver can properly compute the effort objective. For this toy example, u is the only control variable so:
```
state_vars = [x, y]
control_vars = [u]
```
3.) Define a start and goal state for the system. These should be numpy arrays each with the same dimensions as state_vars.
```
X_start = np.array([0, 0]) # arbitrary goal state
X_goal = np.array([1, 0]) # arbitrary goal state
```
4.) Set bounds on the variables. Use None if the variable is not bounded.
```
# bounds = [[lb_x, ub_x],[lb_y, ub_y],[lb_u, ub_u]]
u_max = 10
bounds = [[None,None],[None,None],[-u_max, u_max]]
```

5.) Decide how many nodes to use. More nodes means better accuracy but possibly a longer solve time. pydcol accepts arbitrary node spacings, but does expect that tspan is sorted from t0 to tf and has no repeats.
```
t0 = 0
tf = 1
N  = 10
tspan = np.linspace(t0,tf,N)
```
6.) Define the problem. At this stage, your problem is converted into an objective and constraint function (along with functions to evalute the 1st and second derivatives of those functions). Multiple collocation methods are supported. Here we use hermite-simpson (`HERM`). For a full list of methods, please see pydol/CollocationMethods.py. Also note that X_goal, colloc_method, and custom_objective are optional inputs and can be left out. However, unless you are defining your own objective function through the custom_objective input (see the `examples/CustomObjective.py` script), not defining X_goal will result in a solution with no control input. 
```
problem = CollocationProblem(state_vars, control_vars, ode, tspan, X_start, X_goal, colloc_method=HERM, custom_objective=None)
```
7.) Solve the problem. The scipy.minimize,trust-constr (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.minimize-trustconstr.html) and IPOPT (https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt) solvers are supported. IPOPT takes faster steps and handles large, sparse systems better (>6 states and/or 1000's of nodes). scipy.minimize.trust-constr takes more intelligent steps and handles small systems better (<6 states and/or 100's of nodes). 
```
sol_c = problem.solve(bounds=bounds, solver='scipy')
```
It is up to the user to ask reasonable things of the optimizer. Ensure that it is physically possible for your system to go from the state X_start to X_goal in the provided time bounds. A good initial guess is not always mandatory but often helps.

8.) Compare the solution to an IVP solution. The control trajectory from the collocation solution found in step 7 is used to integrate the system from t0 to tf. scipy.integrate.solve_ivp is used. The ivp solver can be selected using ivp_method. We recommend implicit methods unless the control trajectory is very smooth.
```
problem.evaluate(ivp_method='Radau')
```

Please see the examples for more illustrations of how to use the library.

## Repo TODO List
Easy problems:
- [ ] Add support for Differential Algebraic Equations's
- [ ] Add support for using time as a term in the system equations.

Challenging problems:
- [ ] Generalize the current node setup (where we support X_i, X_mid, X_i+1) to the general case of a group of n nodes so that we can support any integration scheme.
- [ ] Allow the user to provide a Butcher-Table and use that to define the integration scheme used by pdcol.
- [ ] Add support for problems where the final time is not fixed and/or where we want to minimize the final time.
- [ ] Improve the interface for custom objectives so that users do not have to derive their own jacobian and hessian functions.
- [ ] Connect to more solvers (specifically an SQP solver). 
- [ ] Clean up the solver interface for IPOPT
- [ ] Automate installing IPOPT for Windows and Mac users.
