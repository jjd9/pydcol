# pydcol
This is a repo for ME 397 Numerical methods project

The goal of pydcol is to solve optimal control problems for ode systems.

The specific problem pydcol solves for a given system is to find an open-loop control trajectory connecting an initial system state to a final system state over a fixed time interval. The control trajectory provided by pydcol minimizes the control effort which is the integral of the sum of all the control inputs squared.
